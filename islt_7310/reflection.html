        <h1>A Personal Reflection</h1>
        <h2>Looking back on my time in higher education</h2>
        <div>
            <p>
                <span style="color: green;">I</span> had never taken an online course until I attended my university. In my sophomore year, I took a world cultures course that changed my outlook on how education can be offered. I took as many online courses as I could during my time at the University of Central Missouri; unfortunately, in my program this only led to me taking one course every-other-semester with one specific instructor. Online courses were not particularly popular at that time at my Division-II rural university. However, knowing that I could engage in a course from anywhere on campus, especially in my residence hall, had me hooked. I went on to graduate school where online courses were still not offered, even at the request of a very motivated and vocal student (me). Sadly, the squeaky wheel did not get the grease that day, nor did it over the course of my two-year program.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                After I graduated with my graduate degree, my husband and I went and spent time in Arizona. We saw the sights, had a lot of great experiences, and then came back to Missouri to begin our respective careers. After a brief stint working for the State of Missouri, I joined Mizzou as an academic advisor in the College of Health Sciences (CHS) nee: School of Health Professions (SHP). A senior advisor in my office left approximately two months into my time with CHS, and this led to my Assistant Director asking me if I wanted to advise our online population for Health Sciences and Public Health. I immediately took this opportunity, and it has changed the course of my career. I have now worked with online students, faculty, and staff in some capacity for the past four and half years. 
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph">
                Becoming involved in the access and support of online education opportunities for students pursuing higher education, including recruitment, retention, and program management, has been rewarding and challenging. Within the past three years, both on-campus and online courses have shifted. Challenges in equitable treatment of this student population have come up time and time again in my work in these areas, stemming from miscommunications in expectations due to course structure and accessibility. Online enrollment is increasing at universities across the nation, and my team and I are constantly working to be better professionals to support this infrastructure and make these programs comparable to the on-campus program experience. Unlike on-campus programs, we do not have hundreds of years to sculpt the structure of these online programs. Rather, online programs have had to rapidly adapt in the past twenty years.
            </p> 
            
             <p class="paragraph">
                Expectations for distance education programs have changed and evolved and continue to do so frequently. Due to this, my professional development opportunities focus on understanding the tools to help our organization become better leaders in this area and understanding the tools that will give our students an equitable and equal experience across the programs I serve. With the upcoming demographic slide of 2025, online programs can shine and serve nontraditional students like never before. I look forward to being a part of that and seeing how this area of higher education continues to evolve and adapt.
