<h3>Advisors Forum Professional Development Series</h3>
                        <p>Every year at the Mizzou campus, a Professional Development and Service Day is hosted by the Advisors Forum. This event is intended to give staff members a day devoted to development, gain a better sense of community, and come out of the process refreshed. When March 2020 hit, I was newly elected to serve as the Communication Chair for Advisors Forum for the upcoming academic year, which is the chair that plans this event. Taking into account the mandates at this time, I had to create a virtual event with no set precedent. I solely created and hosted the first online professional development event for campus staff offered through Advisors Forum. This series was implemented online via Zoom over a three-day period, included 5 guest speakers, and had approximately 90 attendees per day. This event also partnered with Tiger Pantry and completed a successful food drive.</p>

                           <br>

                        <p>This experience taught me a lot. First and foremost, conferences require a lot of moving pieces and it truly is a balancing act. This was also my first experience (of many) with Zoom recordings and hosting an event of this size for full time staff members. During a time when all of our meetings and student appointments were also via Zoom, I was pleasantly surprised with the success of this event.</p>
                    <br>
    <p>I was also producing bi-semester newsletters to keep the campus staff up-to-date on new and seasonal processes. Here is an example of a newsletter I produced:</p>

<h3 id="transferequivalencyguides>Transfer Equivalency Guides</h3>
                        <p>Transfer students coming into a new university can feel overwhelmed, underprepared, and like they do not have the same welcome as traditional students. To combat some of this, an area I was advising in started creating transfer guides for these students (and their advisors) to help boost transparency. Partnering with the key campus players, I created transfer equivalency guides to assist students transferring from community colleges into the MU College of Health Sciences. I then completed the subsequent guides for the community colleges we saw the most transfers from. This included an individual guide specific to every major offered in the College of Health Sciences.</p>
                        <br>

                           <br>
                        <p>Cross-departmental collaboration is necessary for faculty and staff to fully support our students, and it’s necessary to achieve a sense of belongingness and open communication with our students. While I knew this prior to this project, it really hit home that we can be doing so much more for our students and their families if the proper support is in place.</p>
                  <br>
<h3>Accelerated MBA</h3>
                        <p> Working with key players at the Trulaske College of Business and across Mizzou, I successfully created the accelerated Master of Business Administration (MBA) program for the current Bachelor of Science in Business Administration (BSBA). This program allows students to take courses towards their graduate degree during their senior year, and then complete their MBA in one-year post-graduation. This effort included creating academic plans for all BSBA emphasis areas, gaining approval of these plans by the Office of the University Registrar (OUR) and the Undergraduate Advising Director in the College of Business, and working with OUR to navigate the details surrounding both course and student coding. In addition to being solely responsible for the program build and implementation, I also independently created the marketing materials for this program.</p>
                                               <br>
 <div class="image"><img src="https://kefr7t.github.io/islt_7310/Accelerated MBA Poster (1).png">
                           <br>
                  <p>This project was challenging. It pushed me to further understand the needs of faculty and students while balancing those needs with the “wants” of those involved. Overall, I’m proud of what I accomplished, and I am proud to say the program is currently in their pilot year with 4 enrolled students.</p>
                        <br>
                    <p>Additional marketing materials I have produced are included below:</p>
